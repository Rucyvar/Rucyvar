## 👋 About Me

I'm a recent graduate with a strong passion for **Data Science**, eager to apply my academic knowledge and hands-on project experience to real-world problems. My expertise lies in **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **data visualization**, with a solid foundation in relevant coursework.

I consider myself a **quick learner** and **detail-oriented**, always aiming to deliver actionable, data-driven insights. Whether it's exploring new algorithms, analyzing datasets, or visualizing complex information, I am committed to finding meaningful patterns and solutions.

Currently, I'm looking for opportunities to grow and apply my skills in a collaborative environment. Let's connect and solve some data-driven challenges together!
